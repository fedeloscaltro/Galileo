See the ISS and Discovery in the morning sky over Europe
Early tomorrow morning there is a rare opportunity to see the Space Station flying in formation with Space Shuttle Discovery, homeward bound and due to land in Florida tomorrow evening.
Between 06:30 and 06:37 CET the ISS, followed at a distance by Discovery, will fly along a line stretching from Cadiz (Spain), over Barcelona, Marseilles (France), Turin and Milan in northern Italy, toward Austria.
Residents of Paolo Nespoli's home town of Verano Brianza, near Milan, should have a clear view as they wake up. For early risers in Sicily, southern Italy, and Greece, the Station and Shuttle will be visible one orbit or 90 minutes earlier, between 04:59 and 05:03 CET (05:59 and 06:03 Eastern European Time for Greece).
For precise times over your home town, consult 'Heavens Above'.
Discovery and the STS-120 crew undocked from the Space Station at 11:32 CET, 5 November, and are scheduled to touchdown in Florida at 19:02 CET (18:02 UT) on Wednesday 7 November.
