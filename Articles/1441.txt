Logo unveiled for OasISS mission
ESA today unveiled the logo for astronaut Frank De Winne’s six-month mission to the International Space Station. De Winne’s OasISS mission is set for launch on 27 May and will see him become the first European commander of the Station, in October 2009.
During his stay on the International Space Station (ISS), De Winne will conduct scientific experiments for scientists from different European countries and others worldwide. He will also perform technology demonstrations and an education programme.
De Winne will be one of two operators of the Station’s robotic arm during the docking of the first Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV-1) when it arrives at the ISS in September. He will also operate the Japanese robotic arm to help install external payloads on the Japanese Kibo laboratory.
OasISS, the second European long-duration mission to the ISS, will enlarge the crew to six astronauts for the first time and thereby increase the time available for scientific experiments.
In addition to depicting the ISS and Earth as oases for astronauts and humankind, the mission logo features the theme of water as the basis of life as we know it.
Our planet is shown as a drop of water, resembling Earth as seen by the astronauts on the ISS. The importance of water for life is represented by the tree that grows out of the arms of a man. He is rooted in the Station and its scientific utilisation. Water flows through the man’s arms and the branches of the tree.
The rocket illustrates the Soyuz that will carry Frank De Winne to the ISS. A single white star symbolises how human exploration will eventually lead humankind to other planets.
