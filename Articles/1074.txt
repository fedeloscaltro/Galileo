SpaceTweetup with André Kuipers: ask @Astro_Andre
Are you following @Astro_Andre’s Twitter updates and images from space? If you could speak to him live on the International Space Station, what would you most like to ask? Now’s your chance!
ESA is inviting 80 followers of @Astro_Andre to join us for a SpaceTweetup, with André participating live from the Space Station.
The Tweetup will take place in English on 29 May at ESA’s ESTEC research and technology centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.
ESA astronaut Christer Fuglesang will introduce participants to the Space Station and André’s PromISSe mission, followed by a tour of the Erasmus Centre and its displays of ESA’s microgravity research platforms. A tour of ESTEC will include the satellite test centre and space simulator.
