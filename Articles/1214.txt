New video released: Yuri Gagarin - Inspiration for European astronauts
ESA pays tribute to five decades of human spaceflight with a video from the European Astronaut Centre remembering the historic flight of 12 April 1961.
Yuri Gagarin was the first to see Earth from space and his legacy has motivated many young people to follow careers in science and engineering - and to become astronauts.
