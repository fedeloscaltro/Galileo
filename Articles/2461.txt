The new ISS Education Kit: OUT NOW!
Since July 2003 it has been possible to sign up for a free copy of the ISS Education Kit for secondary schools. The Dutch, English, and German versions are now ready for distribution. NOTE: French version now also available.
The ISS Education Kit is aimed at teachers of secondary school pupils aged 12-15. ESA has developed the kit using input from teachers. It was first produced in a pilot version in 2002. Since then, the kit has been tested and improved as a result of the feedback.
The new ISS Education Kit is being printed in 40 000 copies in no less than 11 languages. It will be distributed to interested teachers throughout Europe as soon as the various language versions are available.
The Spanish version will be available next. Later in the year, the kit will also be printed in Danish, Finnish, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese and Swedish.
Contents of the kit
Five chapters use various aspects of ISS to present inter-disciplinary exercises common to European curricula. The text describes what the ISS is, how it is being built, what it is like to live and work on board, and what future voyages will be like. The kit also includes a teacher's guide, a glossary, and colour overhead transparencies.
Modules can be taught in the classroom, used to facilitate group exercises, given as homework, or copied and distributed to each pupil.
