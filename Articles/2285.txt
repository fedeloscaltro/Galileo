Watch ESA astronaut Alexander return to Earth
After spending almost six months in space running experiments and maintaining the International Space Station, ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst will return to Earth on Monday.
Alexander will climb into the Soyuz spacecraft with Roscosmos cosmonaut Max Suraev and NASA astronaut Reid Wiseman on 10 November ready to leave their home in space. Their three-hour trip back to Earth will reduce their speed from 28 800 km/h to zero.
Their bumpy ride begins as they hit the atmosphere and they jettison parts of their spacecraft. Parachutes will deploy and retrorockets will fire an instant before touchdown to slow them down for a dramatic but safe landing.
Watch their return live with images from space and the support team on hand in Kazakhstan via NASA television. The programming schedule is in Central European Time (subtract one hour for GMT).
