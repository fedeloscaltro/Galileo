Meet astronaut Luca Parmitano
Did you follow ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano’s updates and images during his Volare space mission on social media? Now there’s a chance to hear about his time on the International Space Station directly from Luca.
ESA is inviting 50 followers of @Astro_Luca to join us for a SocialSpace event, open to all his followers on social networks, such as Twitter, Facebook and Google+.
The event will take place on 11 April at ESA’s ESRIN facility in Frascati, Italy, starting at 16:00 CEST (in English).
