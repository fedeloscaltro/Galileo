New online education product for secondary schools
The ISS Education Team today launches a new product: the ISS Education Kit on the web. An adaptation of the successful paper-based ISS Education Kit, the ISS Education Kit on the web provides teachers with a new online resource for teaching space-related topics to pupils aged 12-15.
The online kit contains interactive exercises and multimedia features, which make use of the extra possibilities offered by the Internet. Supporting tools help teachers and pupils to find their way through the online kit and complete the exercises.
A panel of secondary school teachers, including representatives from all over Europe, provided their expert advice on design and content issues through discussions during a workshop held last February and remotely via Internet and email. While under development the product was also thoroughly tested by a group of schoolchildren from an international school in The Netherlands.
For now the ISS Education Kit on the web is available in English, other ESA Member State languages will be added over the coming months.
