ESA's Commercial Agent for Biotechnology, Health and Food and Nutrition at BIO 2005
ESA's Commercial Agent once again crosses boundaries to promote International Space Station research opportunities to the Biotechnology community â€“ this time it even set out for another continent. The BIO 2005 trade show in Philadelphia, USA, taking place 19-22 June, hosts over 1500 biotechnology companies from 61 nations, making it one of the largest and most important events of the year in the biotechnology industry.
ESA, represented through its Commercial Agent Network for Biotechnology, Health and Food and Nutrition, has a dedicated area on the booth of the German biotechnology company EMBLEM GmbH, one of the Commercial Agent Network's partner companies.
"BIO 2005 is an excellent chance for ESA to promote their business opportunities on the International Space Station and to create some visibility in the biotechnology community", says Martin Raditsch, Deputy Managing Director of EMBLEM, the commercial arm of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and member of the Commercial Agent Network.
"The BIO 2005 trade fair gives us the chance to get the message across of the unique R&D opportunities ESA offers on the International Space Station to the biotechnology industry and to gather a lot of high level business contacts in the sector."
More than 18 000 people are expected to attend BIO 2005.
