New Glenn is a single-configuration, operationally reusable launch vehicle powered by seven BE-4 liquefied natural gas rocket engines and offers significant performance margin for all NSS missions.The LSA partnership enables rapid buildout of NSS-unique New Glenn infrastructure such as vertical payload integration capability and a launch site at Vandenberg Air Force Base as well as completion of NSS certification activities.Blue Origin is proud to serve the NSS community and is committed to providing safe, reliable access to space for the nation.For more information on this announcement, check out the Air Force’s press release, Blue’s tweet and Jeff’s tweet.Gradatim Ferociter!
