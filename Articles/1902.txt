Students to launch fictitious communication campaigns for business opportunities on ISS
Creating a communication campaign for a prestigious international organisation: a challenge most communication specialists would jump at. Just such an opportunity now opens up for students at the Free University of Brussels who have the chance to develop a communication campaign for ESA.
Under the theme "Space Reaching out to Business", the 5th Junior Campaign Contest invites the students of Communication or Applied Economic Sciences to create a "Space Marketing Campaign" promoting new business opportunities offered by the European Space Agency on the International Space Station (ISS). The students, who have founded twelve fictive junior communication agencies, will compete to create the best campaign.
Six of the twelve junior agencies will win a place in the final. A 21-member jury, chaired by Belgian ESA astronaut Frank De Winne, and consisting of major players from communication, advertising and journalism will judge the contest.
The campaigns will also be subject to the scrutiny of ESA specialists with expertise in selling business opportunities in the space sector to the non-space world: Maurizio Belingheri, Head of ESAâ€™s Commercialisation Division, and Frank Salzgeber, Head of Business Development.
The winning junior agency team will earn the title "Best Junior Space Marketing Campaign 2005".
The six finalists in the 5th Junior Campaign Contest will enter the ring on the 20 April 2005 at the Free University of Brussels, "Oefenplein" Campus.
