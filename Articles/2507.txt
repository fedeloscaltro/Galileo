7th Student Parabolic Flight Campaign Day 4: Frozen Space Researchers
Team 1057 - TU-Ilmenau, University Würzburg, 2nd University of NaplesOur team woke up at 6.30 to a cold morning in Bordeaux to finish the experiment in the facility. We arrived at Novespace at 7.00 and prepared for the safety visit.
At 11.00 we left our emplacement on the Airbus A300 to allow the experts to check the experiments. We then tidied our workshop area, went to have lunch and then received our flight suits for Monday’s familiarisation flight. Like most of the teams, we tried on the suits and took photos of all the team members dressed up as astronauts!
We waited in the workshop area during the entire safety visit, as we were the last team to be called into the plane. Finally, our team was called in for the visit with the safety experts. Many people looked at our experiment and checked if everything was all right. We sweated a bit, but in the end everything was okay! And best of all... all the teams passed!
