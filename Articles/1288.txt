Mars500 video diary no. 2 - Romain Charles completes the tour
In part 2 of the Mars500 video diary Romain Charles shows us around the control room, the medical facility where the crew do experiments, and where they sleep and eat. Catch a glimpse of his Russian crewmates preparing lunch - see what's for dinner and what's growing in the greenhouse.
