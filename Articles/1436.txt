ESA presents the new European astronauts at its Paris Headquarters on 20 May
ESA PR 09-2009. ESA began the search for new astronauts in 2008, calling for applications from talented European citizens who wished to join the European Astronaut Corps to conduct future missions to the International Space Station, and one day to the Moon and beyond.
Following a very demanding selection process, which started out with 8413 valid applications, ESA is ready to announce the individuals who are to become the new European astronauts. Jean-Jacques Dordain, ESA Director General, and Simonetta Di Pippo, ESA Director of Human Spaceflight, will present them at ESA Headquarters on 20 May.
On that occasion, media are invited to a press conference at ESA Headquarters starting at 13:15 CEST. Media representatives wishing to attend the event are kindly requested to fill in the attached accreditation form and return it by fax to the ESA Headquarters Media Relations Office: + 33 (0)1 5369 7690.
