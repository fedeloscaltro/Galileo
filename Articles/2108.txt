Automated Transfer Vehicle under the spotlight at ESA/ESTEC
ESA PR 16-2002. On Tuesday 9 April the European Space Agency is staging the first presentation of the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), Europe's new multifunctional spacecraft to supply the International Space Station.
This will be a unique opportunity to see the ATV in fully stacked configuration before its launch. The presentation to the media will be at ESA's Research and Technology Centre, ESTEC, in Noordwijk, the Netherlands.
The International Space Station requires regular deliveries of equipment for scientific and commercial utilisation, fuel to raise its altitude, spare parts, and food, air and water for its permanent crew. From the first operational flight of the ATV in autumn 2004, Europe's most challenging spacecraft will play a vital role in station servicing.
Depending on the operational lifetime of the Space Station, ESA will build at least 8 ATVs. The project involves 30 companies from ten European countries under the prime contractorship of EADS Launch Vehicles (France), which is also overseeing 8 companies from Russia and the United States participating in development of the spacecraft.
Media representatives are invited to attend the ATV presentation, the programme for which is as follows:
