New Shepard Successfully Flies 8 NASA Research & Technology Payloads to Space
NS-10 was the 4th flight for this New Shepard booster - January 23, 2019 Blue Origin demonstrated the versatility of the New Shepard system by taking 8 NASA-sponsored research and technology payloads into space today. This flight was dedicated to NASA’s Flight Opportunities program, an essential program for researchers providing access to microgravity for technology development. Blue supports NASA’s Flight Opportunities program and its role in perfecting technology for a future human presence in space.New Shepard’s reusability is lowering launch costs and creating routine access to space. Lowering the cost of microgravity research increases the opportunities for universities, government researchers and entrepreneurs to test payloads and technologies in space. The launch was the 10th successful mission for the New Shepard program and the 4th flight for this vehicle. It was another great practice run towards regular payload flights with our growing fleet of launch vehicles.Click here to see a post from our founder about the mission.  Flying New Shepard more frequently is critically important to the future of Blue Origin. It moves us toward our ultimate goal to lower the cost of access to space and move heavy industry off Earth so we can use space to benefit Earth.Additionally, the continued success and proven stability of this configuration on a subscale confirms we are using the methods, operations and technology needed for our larger scale programs.In an upcoming mission, New Shepard will take payloads to space from around the world.
