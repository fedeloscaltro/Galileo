The conference will jointly host the 9th ESA Life Sciences Symposium and 26th Annual International Society for Gravitational Physiology (ISGP) Meeting.
Programme
During open sessions there will be paper presentations on the effects of changes in magnitude and direction of the gravitational force environment on the physiology and behaviour of humans, animals, plants and cells.
The effects of weightlessness during spaceflight, acute and chronic acceleration, impact, vibration and the various forms of simulated weightlessness will be included, as well as consideration of the evolutionary consequences of gravity and the role of gravity in the manifestations of scale effects in animals and plants.
