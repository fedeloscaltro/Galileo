NASA briefings on ISS missions
NASA has announced two media briefings on the current and next long-duration missions to the International Space Station (ISS). The briefings will take place on Tuesday 22 August at 20:00 CEST (18:00 UT) and 21:00 CEST (19:00 UT), and will be broadcast live on NASA TV.
The briefings will focus on the Station's ongoing Expedition 13 mission and the upcoming Expedition 14 mission, which will launch with the Soyuz spacecraft next month.
ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter became a member of the Expedition 13 crew shortly after his arrival at the Station with Space Shuttle Discovery on 6 July. Continuing his long-duration stay on ISS, Reiter becomes a member Expedition 14 following the crew exchange in September.
