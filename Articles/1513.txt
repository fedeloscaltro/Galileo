European Astronaut Selection: A few days left to apply!
Aspiring astronauts still have some time to fill in their online application forms before the closing date of Monday 16 June and, who knows, they may get the chance to join an elite team and fly in space.
ESA began its selection procedure for new astronauts in May, calling for applications from talented individuals who wish to join the European Astronaut Corps. There has not been a selection campaign since 1992, so this is a rare opportunity to be at the forefront of ESA’s human spaceflight programmes, including future missions to the ISS, the Moon and beyond.
“The application phase is a very exciting period for the entire ESA Astronaut Selection Team. We already have a large number of highly qualified applicants but it is still possible to apply until Monday 16 June, and why should not one of those selected be among the very last to apply?” said Gerhard Thiele, Head of the European Astronaut Corps and ESA Astronaut Selection Project Manager.
Applicants from all 17 Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom) are welcome to apply.
