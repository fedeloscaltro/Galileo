Malargüe tracking station powered up
On 29 November, the power plant at ESA's new 35m deep space station in Malargüe was connected to the public power network. The key construction milestone was overseen by the Governor of Argentina's Mendoza Province and the Mayor of Malargüe. A power line was specially deployed to the DSA3 site by the same local company that built the power plant to the highest quality standards. Connecting power was one of the last major milestones before lifting the huge 35 m-diameter antenna onto the station support, set for early in December.
