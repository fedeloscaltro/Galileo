OasISS preflight crew press conference
ESA astronaut Frank De Winne is scheduled to spend six months on the International Space Station starting from May. In October 2009, he is set to become the first European ISS Commander. His mission, called OasISS, will focus on scientific research, technology and education. Media representatives are invited to attend a preflight crew press conference on 4 March.
Hosted by ESA's Directorate of Human Spaceflight, the press conference will cover all aspects of the mission. There will also be an opportunity to put questions to De Winne and his fellow crewmembers who will take time out from their training programme at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston to join the event by video conference.
Important mission
The OasISS mission is important in many ways. For the first time the International Space Station (ISS) will see an increase in the size of the permanent crew from three to six. Furthermore, De Winne will be the first European commander of the ISS. As Commander, he will be responsible, among other things, for conducting operations on the ISS, directing crew activities, ensuring the safety of the crew and the protection of the ISS elements, equipment and payloads.
During his stay on the ISS, De Winne will conduct scientific experiments developed by scientists from different European countries and others worldwide. In addition, he will perform technology demonstrations and an education programme. De Winne will also be instrumental in operating the Station's robotic arm and that of the Kibo module, to help install the external payloads for the Japanese laboratory.
Columbus
Frank De Winne previously spent 10 days onboard the ISS during his Odissea mission in 2002. Since then, much has changed at the orbital outpost. In March 2008, ESA successfully launched Jules Verne, the first Automated Transfer Vehicle, delivering supplies and hardware the Station. One month earlier, the European Columbus laboratory was added to the ISS, at which point Europe became a fully operational ISS partner, providing a permanent orbital infrastructure in which to perform its own scientific research programme.
