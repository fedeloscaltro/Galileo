Our machines are running 24 hours per day, seven days per week. We are producing daily shipments of the visors to our supply partner, Stratasys, who is distributing them to hospitals in need around the country. This initiative started organically within Blue as our engineers and machinists were looking for ways to help. The Blue Origin team members currently supporting this effort work on our BE-4 engine development and are volunteering their time for this endeavor. To ensure effective social distancing measures, we are requiring that only one volunteer work in the area at a time. Blue Origin wants to thank every doctor, nurse, first responder and medical staff on the frontlines combating COVID-19.
