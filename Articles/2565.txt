ESA astronauts go EVA
Altogether 168 spacewalks will be needed in the next five years to complete the assembly of the International Space Station (ISS), a joint undertaking by the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan and 10 ESA Member States.
New footage from ESA shows an interview with two ESA astronauts, Claude Nicollier and Thomas Reiter, and describes some aspects of the training needed to prepare for working in space on the ISS and for carrying out extra-vehicular activities (EVA).

The first European to visit the ISS will be ESA astronaut Umberto Guidoni, who is due to take part in an 11-day Shuttle mission tentatively scheduled for 19 April 2001. ESA astronaut, Claudie Andre-Dehays will follow him in October 2001. Claudie has already commenced training at Star City, near Moscow, for her voyage aboard a Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.
The new footage is also available in German.
