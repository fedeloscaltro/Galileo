Blue Origin’s BE-4 Engine Selected by ULA to Power Vulcan
We have some exciting news to share with you! Blue Origin’s BE-4 engine has been selected by United Launch Alliance to power the Vulcan rocket. See the statement below from our CEO, Bob Smith, regarding today’s announcement. Today is a great day for the Blue Origin team. We are very honored that United Launch Alliance has selected Blue Origin’s LOX/LNG BE-4 as the engine that will power the first stage of their Vulcan rocket. United Launch Alliance is the premier launch service provider for national security missions, and we’re thrilled to be part of their team and that mission.
We can’t thank Tory Bruno and the entire United Launch Alliance team enough for entrusting our engine to power Vulcan. The Blue team is looking forward to developing our production facility for our BE-4 engine in Huntsville over the next year.
Bob Smith, Blue Origin, CEO
