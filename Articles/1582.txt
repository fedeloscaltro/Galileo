Full coverage on ESA's Columbus Blog
The Columbus Blog is online, and will run through to the end of the Space Shuttle Atlantis STS-122 mission. ESA's Columbus Blog will cover the intense activity supporting the delivery of the Columbus lab - Europe's cornerstone contribution to the ISS - to space.
This blog is operated by ESA as an unofficial and in-depth source of information. It will be updated by the media team of ESA - the European Space Agency, and we plan to have direct input from the Columbus lab ground controllers, ESA astronauts and Web editors at the Columbus Control Centre, Germany, and the Kennedy and Johnson Space Centers, USA.
The Columbus Blog is provided strictly on an unofficial basis and ESA makes no warranty that the information in any of the postings is confirmed or official - but the team here will certainly do their best to get you the most accurate information possible, as soon as possible!
