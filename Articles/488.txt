Happy New Year on Mars
Five, four, three, two, one…. FIREWORKS! The countdown to a new year is in many ways a defining moment for our lives on Earth. Our age, our seasons, filing our taxes… – all depend on the duration of Earth’s orbit around the Sun.
On Mars, there are no yearly tax returns, but as the planet also orbits around our Sun, time on Mars is similarly measured in years. However, there are some significant differences between a year on Mars and a year on Earth. As we approach New Year’s Eve on Mars, let’s look at some similarities and differences between a year on the two planets.
7 February 2021 marks the start of Year 36 on Mars. The dates of the next couple of New Years can be found in the table below.
If you’re looking for a reason to celebrate, here’s to a Happy New Mars Year!
