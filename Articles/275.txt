“Let’s go to the Moon” is key focus at IAC 2018
Moving heavy industry from Earth into space is at the core of Blue Origin’s mission. The future will be better for our children – and our children’s children – if we use space to benefit life on Earth and enable millions of people to live and work in space.The next logical step in this path is a return to the Moon. To do this we need reusable access to the lunar surface and its resources. We’re in the conceptual design phase of a large lunar lander that will provide that access called Blue Moon.We are not alone in our drive to return to the Moon, and there have been some exciting updates this week at the 69th Annual International Astronautical Congress in Bremen, Germany.Blue has joined leading space companies and agencies to support the creation of The Moon Race, a non-profit working to launch a competition for teams looking for a ride to the lunar surface. The goal is consistent with our aim to land large payloads on the Moon that can access and utilize the resources found there. We’re supporting this initiative, along with ESA, Airbus, and other entities seeking to foster the next generation of lunar exploration – with Blue Moon and New Glenn.We’re also excited to announce a collaboration with OHB SE and MT Aerospace on a future Blue Moon mission.Check out our tweets about The Moon Race and OHB announcements for more information.Gradatim Ferociter!
