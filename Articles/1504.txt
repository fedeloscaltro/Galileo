European rocket and balloon research symposium
The 19th ESA Symposium on European Rocket and Balloon Programmes and Related Research will be held in Bad Reichenhall, Germany, 7-11 June 2009. Scientists and engineers who would like to present a paper at the symposium are invited to submit a Notification of Interest via the symposium website.
This symposium provides a platform for scientists and engineers using sounding rockets and balloons for their research, and to advance progress in related scientific disciplines. The scope of the symposium also includes related ground-based, aircraft and satellite research, new developments in technology, and improvements of range facilities.
Symposium participants are given the opportunity to report both on their latest achievements and plans for the future in the various scientific and technical fields. New trends and the latest developments in the use of sounding rockets and balloons for scientific research will be highlighted. This will facilitate the establishment of a strategic and lasting roadmap towards the future of these activities.
Invited review papers will present the state of scientific and technical knowledge in fields of specific interest. Oral and poster contributions are also solicited, the latter being accompanied by short oral summary presentations.
There will be opportunities for special project meetings and working group discussions. Roundtable discussions on sounding rocket- or balloon-related topics can also be arranged upon request.
The Symposium will be held at the 'Altes Kurhaus' in Bad Reichenhall in Bavaria, Germany. The symposium is organised and sponsored by ESA with the support of the German Aerospace Center, DLR.
