Live BBC interview with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli
The BBC World Service TV programme Impact will interview ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli live from the International Space Station at 14.00 GMT (15:00 CET) today. The interview will also be broadcast on BBC World News and BBC News Channel.
Together with the host of the show, Tim Willcox, sitting in the studio talking with Paolo there will also be ESA’s Director of Human Spaceflight, Simonetta Di Pippo, and one of Europe’s six new astronauts, Tim Peake.
Paolo will talk about life aboard the Station and the experiments he is performing. Key events during his MagISStra mission include the arrival of Japan’s HTV-2 unmanned ferry later this month and, in February, the docking of Europe’s ATV-2 vessel under his watchful gaze.
Paolo is also looking forward to taking part in the multi-location launch event of the Greenhouse in Space educational project involving many European school kids on 17 February.
