ESA's ISS Education Kit crosses borders
Although secondary school teachers who request ESA's ISS Education Kit are required to work within one of the agency's Member State countries, it recently emerged that a copy of the kit has found its way to Pakistan.
Shahzad Munir from Gujranwala, an industrial city in northeast Pakistan, wrote to thank the ISS Education Team for providing him with the material. In his letter Munir explains how he and his colleagues voluntarily visit the local schools to promote an awareness of space science.
"We hope to bring about a healthy and positive change in the behaviour and attitude of the people of Pakistan towards space travel," Munir writes.
He goes on to explain how they plan to visit a different school in the city each week. One of the first visits was to a local grammar school where there was a very enthusiastic response from teachers and students alike.
Enclosing photos of the class at work, as well as a number of worksheets completed by the students, Munir continues, "The students were very keen and interested in the information. They had many questions about working on the International Space Station."
Since its release in November 2003, over 30 000 copies of ESA's ISS Education Kit have been distributed to secondary school teachers throughout ESA's Member States, it would appear though that some copies may have literally crossed a few more borders.
