Troubleshooting continues at KSC
NASA continues to troubleshoot the engine cut-off sensor problem which delayed the launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis with the European Columbus laboratory. Managers are scheduled to convene on 27 December to continue discussions. For the latest updates, please consult the NASA website.
Space Shuttle programme managers approved a plan earlier this week to prepare to remove foam around a connector on the external fuel tank of Space Shuttle Atlantis. The decision was based on analysis of the data from a thorough test of the fuel level sensor system that was conducted last Tuesday at NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Florida.
Space Shuttle Program Manager Wayne Hale said after the test that the instruments isolated an issue in the fuel sensor system to a connector on the external tank. Engineers will continue evaluating the data. Managers are scheduled to convene again 27 December to discuss the issue and potential remedies.
The fuel sensor system relayed false readings during two launch countdowns for Atlantis on mission STS-122.
The next launch opportunity for Atlantis is no earlier than 10 January 2008.
