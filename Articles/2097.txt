Each series will cover subjects such as satellite navigation, Earth observation, launchers, human spaceflight and microgravity, space science and astronauts. A professional anchorman will conduct the presentations on stage.
3D TV
Twice a day whenever possible (once in the morning and once in the afternoon) a special video link will be set up between ASTRIUM/Bremen, where ESA's Columbus module for the International Space Station is being integrated, and the Space Hall at ILA. The video transmission will be produced in three-dimensional format. The 3D effect is perceived by wearing special glasses when watching standard TV monitors or the projection screen.
Programme managers in Bremen will take remote visitors at the Space Hall through a guided tour of the real Columbus module and reply to questions from the public. ESA specialists and a professional anchorman will conduct the event.
