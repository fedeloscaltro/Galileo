ISS Education Kit presented to maths teachers
What are the latest trends in teaching mathematics all over the world, and how can ESA contribute? This was the main objective of ESAâ€™s participation in the 10th International Congress on Mathematical Education held 4-11 July in Copenhagen, Denmark.
The International congress, organised on this occasion in cooperation among the Nordic countries, offered maths teachers from all over the world the opportunity to exchange views on the best mathematical practices in education, listen to a variety of lectures and to participate in discussion groups or topic study groups.
Throughout the course of the week various organisations presented themselves via exhibition stands. ESA took the opportunity to present the ISS Education Kit for secondary schools, Lift Off! and other educational materials from their stand.
At the stand Solveig Pettersen and Barbara ten Berge, ESA's International Space Station Education Officers explained, "The ISS Education Kit, developed for secondary school pupils between 12 and 15 years old, uses the International Space Station as a context to teach a variety of subjects. Exercises on biology, maths, and chemistry all related to the life and work of astronauts on board the ISS give pupils a feel of their experience in space."
The ISS Education Kit is already available in English, French, German and Dutch. Later this year the kit will also be available in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian.
At the ESA stand, congress participants from the ESA Member State countries could register online for their free copy of the ISS Education Kit. Participants from other countries were shown where they could download the ISS Education Kit in pdf file format.
