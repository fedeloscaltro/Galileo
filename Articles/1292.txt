New ESA astronauts Alexander Gerst and Samantha Cristoforetti will then appear via a live video link, from the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, where they are undergoing basic training.
Thomas Reiter, a member of the German Aerospace Center’s Executive Board, will also participate, taking questions about German activities in spaceflight.
Finally, ESA Director of Human Spaceflight Simonetta Di Pippo will talk about the future of the Agency’s contribution to the space station programme and her vision for Europe’s human spaceflight activities.
