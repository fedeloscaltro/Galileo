Mars500 video diary no. 1 - tour the facilities with Diego Urbina
In this first video diary from the Mars500 crew, Diego Urbina takes us on tour inside the Mars500 facilities - see how the crew are living and working for the next 17 months in isolation.
The Mars500 crew sent multi-language greetings to life scientists meeting in Trieste this week at ESA's Life Sciences Symposium.
