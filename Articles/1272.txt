Call for Media: press conference with ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli
ESA PR 2010-20 ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli will travel to the International Space Station in December on a six-month mission, serving as flight engineer for Expeditions 26 and 27. This will be the third long-duration mission by a European astronaut on the Station.
Media are invited to learn more about his mission at a press conference in ESTEC, Noordwijk, the Netherlands, hosted by Simonetta Di Pippo, Director of Human Spaceflight, with a live link to Paolo Nespoli in Houston.
Paolo will be launched on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in mid-December, together with Russian cosmonaut Dmitri Kondratyev and NASA astronaut Catherine Coleman.
Paolo is now in training for his challenging mission. His duties aboard the International Space Station (ISS) include receiving Europe's second ATV supply ferry Johannes Kepler and Japan's HTV. He will also carry out an intensive programme of scientific experiments and educational activities, ranging from radiation monitoring to study of sleep patterns in Space to treat insomnia on Earth.
His educational activities include promoting an international educational programme built around health, well-being and nutrition for children ('Mission X: train like an astronaut'). He will also use ESA's novel 3D camera to show unprecedented views of the ISS and Earth from space.
This will be Paolo's second time in space: he flew to the ISS on the Space Shuttle in 2007, on an Italian space agency flight opportunity, to deliver and install the Node-2 module. On his new mission, he will help to exploit the research capabilities of Europe's Columbus laboratory.
