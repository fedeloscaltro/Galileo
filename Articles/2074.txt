Space and daily life: young people around the world have their say
ESA PR 62-2002. The European Space Agency (ESA) and United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) are jointly participating in World Space Week 2002 by organising a two-day event focussing on the International Space Station (ISS) at ESA’s European Space Research and Technology Centre (ESTEC) in Noordwijk, the Netherlands, on 6/7 October.
On 7 October the award ceremony for the winners of the essay contest organized by UNESCO for high-school students on the theme 'Space and Daily Life' will take place. The contest received 300 responses from around the world. A high-level expert committee, including representatives from the International Space University and Canadian Space Agency, selected the winners on 10 September. With about the same numbers of girls and boys taking part, six girls and one boy had their essays selected.
Carike Bosman from South Africa wrote the most inspiring essay. In her work, the 17-year-old describes humankind’s enthusiasm for space: "Fascination, wonder and even obsession with space and in particular human space travel, have existed throughout many generations."
The special ESA prize for 'Best European Essay' goes to Alastair Evans of the United Kingdom. In his work, Alastair stresses the benefits that space exploration brings to our daily lives: "In the history of space exploration and in the foreseeable future, work has been peaceful and international, promoting good relationships between countries."
Carike and Alastair will both travel to ESTEC for the special award ceremony on 7 October. To make their day at ESTEC even more memorable, the prize winners will be escorted by European astronaut Umberto Guidoni, the first European astronaut on board the International Space Station. Umberto will take the special guests on a Virtual Reality Tour through the ISS and share his personal experiences of space.
ESA experts from the ISS programme will escort the guests on a special tour of the ISS User Information Centre where models of the European contribution to the space station are displayed.
