Call for Media: ESA Mars500 crew in France, Italy and Spain
PR 33 2011 - After their 17-month simulated voyage to the Red Planet, ESA's two Mars500 crewmembers, Romain Charles and Diego Urbina, are returning from Russia. The two will talk about their experience with media in Paris, Rome and near Madrid in early December.
Since their 'landing' on 4 November, the study has continued during the crew’s seclusion in Moscow, with debriefings, medical checks and psychological evaluations. Scientists have been collecting data that may help future astronauts and other professions that involve long stretches of isolation.
On 5 December at 11:00 CET, in Paris, Mars500 and preparing for human space exploration will be presented, before Romain and Diego talk about their experiences during the 520 days in the isolation facility.
The Paris press conferences will be webstreamed on www.esa.int in English and French.
On 6 December at 09:30 CET, at the Boscolo Aleph Hotel in Rome, the two will meet local media, before participating in a Tweeetup at 11:30.
On 7 December at 10:30 CET, at ESAC in Villanueva de la Cañada (Madrid), Spain, Diego Urbina will meet media and a group of university students to talk about his experience.
