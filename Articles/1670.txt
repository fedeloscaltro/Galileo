After successfully soaring to an altitude of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), SpaceX's Starship SN9 prototype smashed into the touchdown site about 6.5 minutes after liftoff, exploding in a massive fireball.
The epic "boom" looked a lot like the fate of SN9's predecessor, SN8, which  launched to an altitude of about 7.8 miles (12.5 kilometers) on Dec. 8, 2020, before returning to the launch pad with a crash.

The shiny, stainless-steel Starship SN9 prototype lifts off from SpaceX's South Texas facility, on the Gulf Coast near the small community of Boca Chica Village, on Feb. 2, 2021, at 3:25 p.m. EST (1825 GMT; 2:25 p.m. local Texas time).

SpaceX's Starship SN9 takes to the skies after lifting off from the company's South Texas site on Feb. 2, 2021. The 165-foot-tall (50 meters) craft appeared to fly well, shutting down its three Raptor engines sequentially as planned, reaching its target altitude of about 6.2 miles (10 kilometers).
The Starship SN9 prototype is seen after a flip maneuver, which SpaceX refers to as a "belly flop," to return to Earth after reaching its target 10-kilometer altitude.

During its descent back to Earth, SN9 did not slow down enough for a vertical landing — nor was the spacecraft completely vertical.

SpaceX's Starship SN9 and SN10 prototypes met at the pad for the first time on Jan. 29, 2021. The SN10 vehicle, SpaceX's latest in a line of new reusable Starship prototypes, rolled out to the pad as its SN9 counterpart awaited its own test flight.
