New target launch date for ATV-3
The launch of ESA's third Automated Transfer Vehicle is targeting 23 March, with a liftoff scheduled for 04:31 GMT (05:31 CET).
A routine inspection concluded that additional measures are required to ensure the maximum readiness of the third Automated Transfer Vehicle for launch. It was therefore decided to postpone the launch previously scheduled for 9 March.
The launch of ATV-3 is part of the internationally coordinated servicing effort to support the International Space Station.
