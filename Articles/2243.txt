Unique stamp sheetlet and collection of postcards
To mark ESA astronaut André Kuipers' PromISSe mission, PostNL composed a unique collection of space postcards and stamp sheetlet in cooperation with the European Space Agency.
The first postcard was formally handed over to Franco Ongaro, Director of ESTEC, by Guido de Wit, Director E-Commerce PostNL Data and Document Management at the launch event in the Space Expo in Noordwijk on 21 December.
The postcard collection consists of a series of 34 cards with images from space with the themes: cities, wonders of the world and space. These cards are only available online on www.kaartwereld.nl or the KaartWereld app for smart phones and tablets.
The stamp sheetlet is a limited edition and includes three postcards from the collection of www.kaartwereld.nl. This kit can be ordered on the website PostNL (www.postnl.nl). The three special stamps show special images of André Kuipers and space. We see André Kuipers during his last space trip, during a training session and images from the International Space Station.
KaartWereld is an online service of PostNL where you can produce and send greeting cards online via your smartphone, tablet or www.kaartwereld.nl.
André Kuipers was launched on 21 December from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, in Kazakhstan, on a Soyuz spacecraft as flight engineer for Expeditions 30 and 31, together with Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko and NASA astronaut Don Pettit. They will remain in space for nearly five months as part of the resident, international six-astronaut crew.
