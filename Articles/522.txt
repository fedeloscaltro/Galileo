SpaceX's Starlink satellite megaconstellation launches in photos
Elon Musk's private spaceflight company SpaceX has been busy building the world's largest satellite internet constellation. Since May 2019, SpaceX has been launching its new Starlink internet satellites in batches of 60, with the goal of creating a "megaconstellation" with thousands of 30,000 small satellites. See photos of SpaceX's Starlink launches in this gallery.
Here's a truly jaw-dropping view of the Starlink satellites with the Earth in the background as seen from the upper stage payload camera of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket after the first launch of 60 Starlink satellites on May 23, 2019.

SpaceX launched a second batch of 60 Starlink satellites on Nov. 11, 2019. This mission, called Starlink 1, was the first launch carrying fully operational Starlink satellites to orbit.
The successful Starlink-1 launch brought the total number of Starlink satellites in orbit up to 120. Musk said SpaceX will need at least 400 Starlink satellites in orbit for "minor" broadband coverage, and 800 satellites aloft for "moderate" coverage.

SpaceX launched the Starlink 18 mission with 60 additional Starlink satellites on Feb. 4, 2021, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. This mission brought the total number of operational Starlink satellites launched up to 1,023 (not including the 30 "production design" and two "Tintin" prototypes launched in 2019 and 2018, respectively).
It was the fifth launch for this Falcon 9 first stage, which had last flown just 27 days earlier — the quickest turnaround between missions for any SpaceX booster. Starlink 18 leapfrogged the Starlink 17 mission, which was supposed to get off the ground on Feb. 1 but was delayed to Feb. 5 due to poor weather.
