Aurora Industry Day
On 1 March ESA will be holding an Aurora Industry Day at ESTEC, the European Space Research and Technology Centre in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. This half-day event will provide participants with an update on recent developments in the Aurora Exploration programme as well as information on new opportunities for collaboration with industry.
The preparatory phase of the Aurora Exploration Programme has now been extended and this, together with additional funding of â‚¬27 million, has allowed the approval of the 2005-2006 workplan. Included in the new plan are opportunities in areas such as scenario development for robotic and human missions, and mission studies and technology development in support of such missions.
Invitations to Tender are now being prepared and ESA and Daniel Sacotte, the Director of Human Spaceflight, Microgravity and Exploration, invite industry, particularly from Aurora Participating States,* to attend the 1 March Aurora Industry Day.
Representatives from the Aurora Programme and the ESA Contract Service will be present at the event to answer questions from industry. The Aurora Industry Day aims to increase mutual understanding and facilitate the bidding process.
Those wishing to participate in this free event should register on the Aurora Industry Days website.
