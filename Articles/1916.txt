Call for life sciences abstracts
Life scientists and young researchers are invited to submit abstracts for presentation at the 'Life in space for life on Earth' Life Sciences Conference, to be held from 26 June to 1 July 2005 in Cologne, Germany.
The conference will jointly host the 9th ESA Life Sciences Symposium and 26th Annual International Society for Gravitational Physiology (ISGP) Meeting.
Programme
There will be open sessions for the presentation of papers dealing with the effects of changes in magnitude and direction of the gravitational force environment on the physiology and behaviour of humans, animals, plants and cells.
The effects of weightlessness during spaceflight, acute and chronic acceleration, impact, vibration and the various forms of simulated weightlessness will be included, as well as consideration of the evolutionary consequences of gravity and the role of gravity in the manifestations of scale effects in animals and plants.
Symposia
Guest speakers will present symposia covering the following topics:
Young researchers
To encourage young researchers who have not previously been involved in space research, Ph.D., post-doctorate and exceptional post-graduate students are also invited to submit their abstracts.
Deadline
Abstracts must be submitted online at http://www.congrex.nl/05a06/ before 1 March 2005.
Registration to attend the conference will open from 1 March to 1 May 2005.
