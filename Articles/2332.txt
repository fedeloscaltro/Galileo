Aurora at Earth & Space Week
The third workshop of ESA’s industry club, the European ISS Business Club will take place on Thursday 17 February from 14:00 – 18:00 hours, during Earth and Space Week in Brussels. The theme: ISS and Beyond” concerns the European space exploration programme.
Through ESA’s Aurora Programme, set up in 2001, Europe has established a European long-term plan for the robotic and human exploration of the solar system, with Mars and the Moon as the primary destinations. Now that the Aurora Exploration Programme comes under the responsibility of the newly created Directorate for Human Spaceflight, Microgravity and Exploration, synergies with the International Space Station Programme will be enhanced.
During the workshop, to be held at Autoworld in Brussels, representatives of ESA, national space agencies and industry will provide background information on European space exploration activities. Detailed information will also be given on the Aurora programme’s exploration strategy, the role of the ISS, opportunities for industry, the technologies needed and other related topics.
Earth and Space week is a joint initiative of the European Commission and ESA. It will show how Earth observation and space improve the quality of life on our planet.
