Shuttle Return to Flight
9 August 2005 - 14:12 CESTSpace Shuttle Discovery and its seven-member crew successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 14:12 CEST.

9 August 2005 - 13:10 CESTSpace Shuttle Discovery is on a trajectory towards Edwards Air Force Base in California following a 2 minute, 42 second de-orbit burn. The Shuttle is on schedule to touchdown on runway 22 at 14:12 CEST.
9 August 2005 - 12:45 CESTMission Control in Houston have just given the crew of Discovery the go-ahead to initiate the de-orbit burn at 13:06 CEST. The Shuttle is scheduled to touchdown at Edwards Air Force Base in California at 14:12 CEST. Weather conditions at Edwards are forecast to be acceptable for the Shuttle landing.
9 August 2005 - 11:08 CESTContinuing unstable weather in Florida has lead Mission Control in Houston to 'wave off' a landing at Kennedy Space Center today. The next landing opportunity, which would lead to a touchdown at 14:12 CEST at Edwards Air Force Base in California, is now being considered.
9 August 2005 - 10:44 CESTThe Discovery crew have been given go-ahead to proceed with landing procedures for the second landing opportunity at 12:43 CEST. Weather conditions at Kennedy Space Center are slightly improved since this morning. A 'go/no-go' decision to proceed with landing will be taken at 11:17 CEST.
9 August 2005 - 09:05 CESTThe first of two oppportunities for landing at Kennedy Space Center this morning has been 'waved off' due to weather conditions. The second opportunity for landing at KSC, which would result in a touchdown at 12:43 CEST, is currently being considered. If the weather remains a problem, the Shuttle could land in California or New Mexico.
8 August 2005 - 11:10 CESTThe landing of Space Shuttle Discovery has been delayed due to unstable weather conditions at the landing site in Florida. The landing at Kennedy Space Center is now scheduled for 11:07 CEST on Tuesday morning.
8 August 2005 - 09:20 CESTThe landing of Space Shuttle Discovery has been delayed due to low broken clouds at the landing site in Florida. The landing is now scheduled for 12:22 CEST. Engine firing to begin descent is planned for 11:15 CEST.
6 August 2005 - 10:00 CESTDiscovery undocked from the International Space Station this morning at 09:24 CEST. The Space Shuttle will continue to orbit Earth until Monday morning when it is due to land at Kennedy Space Center, Florida, at 10:46 CEST
26 July 2005 - 16:39 CESTSpace Shuttle Discovery was successfully launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, at 16:39 CEST today. Discovery is due to dock with the ISS on 28 July at 13:16 CEST.
26 July 2005 - 10:00 CESTSpace Shuttle Discovery is set for launch today at 16.39 CEST (14:39 UT). The launch pad's service structure was rolled away from Discovery on Monday afternoon. Propellant loading was started overnight with the pumping of liquid oxygen and hydrogen into the vehicle's orange External Tank.
Problems relating to a liquid hydrogen low-level fuel sensor inside the external fuel tank prompted postponement of the Shuttleâ€™s launch on 13 July. Since then, engineers have been working around-the-clock on troubleshooting. If any new sensor-related issues occur during today's countdown, engineers would stop the countdown to reassess the situation.
21 July 2005 - 10:00 CESTNASA has announced plans to begin the countdown to a 26 July launch of Space Shuttle Discovery. The countdown will start on Saturday, with a test of the External Tank to follow early on launch day. If all goes well with the test, the countdown will continue to a lift-off at 16:39 CEST on Tuesday.
19 July 2005 - 16:00 CESTNASA is targeting Tuesday 26 July as the earliest possible date to launch the Space Shuttle Discovery on the Return to Flight mission (STS-114).
19 July 2005 - 10:30 CESTNASA continues to work around the clock to determine the cause of an Engine Cut-Off sensor problem that delayed Discovery's first launch attempt. NASA managers are still optimistic about a launch within the current window, which ends 31 July.
15 July 2005 - 09:00 CESTNASA has announced more troubleshooting is necessary to determine why an Engine Cut-Off sensor gave intermittent readings during Wednesday's attempted launch of Space Shuttle Discovery. Further information and a more definite plan could be available Friday. The STS-114 crew will remain at Kennedy Space Center for the time being.
14 July 2005 - 12:00 CESTThe next launch attempt will be no earlier than 20:40 CEST on Saturday 16 July. NASA engineers are analysing a problem with an Engine Cut-Off sensor on Space Shuttle Discovery's External Tank, which delayed the planned launch of the STS-114 mission. A series of meetings will take place Thursday to discuss the problem and determine the steps necessary to get back into the launch countdown.
13 July 2005 - 23:00 CESTToday's launch of Space Shuttle Discovery has been postponed due to an issue with a low-level fuel cut-off sensor onboard the vehicle. The sensor protects the orbiter's main engines by triggering them to shut down in the event fuel runs unexpectedly low.
During their 12-day Return to Flight mission to the International Space Station, Discovery's seven crew members will test new techniques and equipment designed to make Space Shuttles safer. They will also deliver supplies and make repairs to the Space Station.
