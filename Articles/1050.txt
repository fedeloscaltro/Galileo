ESA astronaut Timothy Peake and his crewmates are living in an underwater base off the coast of Florida.
Neemo missions train astronauts for life in space. Living and working in an underwater base is similar to space stations. During the 10-day mission, Tim and his five crewmates will live in cramped conditions, perform ‘waterwalks’ and will have to solve problems as a team.
This year Neemo aquanauts are challenging students to prove their understanding of natural phenomena in an educational programme called Science Under Pressure.
Tim and fellow aquanauts performed a number of educational experiments before diving down to the Neemo base. What will happen when the same experiment is performed under pressure? Will fizzy drinks still have their bubbles? Will toy helicopters be able to fly in the denser air of the underwater base?
Follow Neemo via social media. In addition to the specific Neemo Facebook and Twitter accounts, Tim can send tweets via @Astro_TimPeake. ESA’s astronaut trainers will be blogging and tweeting on ESA’s astronaut blog and via @ESAstro_trainer.
