ESA’s guide to the Moon
ESA has set its sights on our Moon, with a vision of working together with international partners to return to our closest neighbour.
What have scientists learnt about the Moon since the first probe in 1959 and the Apollo lunar landing 10 years later? What questions are unanswered and what is the future of lunar exploration?
An interactive web documentary launched today allows users to explore these questions and the missions to the Moon through European scientists who are working on lunar science right now.
By having the scientists and experts express their views and ideas, the website offers a one-stop-shop to learn about the past, present and future of lunar exploration.
From radio telescopes on the far side of the Moon to how Earth’s natural satellite formed, the interactive documentary is a comprehensive guide for a general audience.
Featuring interviews with scientists from all over Europe and a timeline of all the world’s missions to the Moon, the website is a repository of knowledge where you can keep coming back to find more.
ESA’s Massimo Sabbatini explains: “We built a web documentary where the user is encouraged to discover the content through their own curiosity. We will keep updating the information and expand it to other domains of human and robotic exploration in the future.”
Browse and explore through themes of science and technology or via the lunar missions. You are encouraged to immerse yourself in the many aspects of flying to the Moon and performing science on the Moon. From launch and orbital dynamics, to cameras and rovers, from Surveyor-1 to the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer, users can find out why the Moon is in the spotlight again.
