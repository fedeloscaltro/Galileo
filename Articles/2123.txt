ISS partners release crew criteria document
The International Space Station (ISS) partners have released a document setting out the principles for selecting and assigning astronauts to missions to the ISS. The ISS Crew Criteria Document defines the processes and criteria for selection, assignment, training, and certification of ISS crewmembers.
The document covers a whole range of selection criteria from medical and mental health, through to linguistic ability, team skills and performance under stress. A second part includes details about the assignment of tasks to crewmembers for individual missions.
The five partners in the International Space Station, the United States, Russia, Japan, Canada and 10 European countries represented by the European Space Agency (ESA), will apply the selection criteria and processes prior to nominating their candidates.
Defined by the Multilateral Crew Operations Panel (MCOP), the standards apply to all potential crew members, including space flight participants (non-professional astronauts).
