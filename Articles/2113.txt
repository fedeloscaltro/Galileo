ESA and ASI launch the first sponsorship initiative for European research on board the International Space Station (ISS)
ESA PR 11-2002. The European Space Agency (ESA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) have initiated the first sponsorship programme enabling businesses to participate in the world's largest international science and technology venture in space.
The programme will offer Italian and European companies the opportunity to join the agencies in sponsoring scientific and technological research by astronauts on board the ISS.
Sponsoring such research will contribute to the understanding of human physiology, prevention of diseases, such as osteoporosis, studies on reduction of environmental damage caused by industrial processes, and the creation of new materials and proteins, for the benefit of humankind.
ESA and ASI are looking for businesses that have a mission or ideal consistent with improving the quality of life on Earth and are committed to sustaining research in space, including the involvement of astronauts in these experiments over the coming years.
This is an opportunity for major Italian and European corporations to discover space as a promotional medium, enabling them to project a new image with consumers as committed supporters of improving the quality of life on Earth. The space research setting will show their brands in a uniquely new light.
The two Agencies have entrusted ALTEC, which utilises the professional expertise of Campobase, with development of the overall marketing strategy for this new sponsorship initiative. The first sponsorship opportunity will be the 'Taxi Flight' to the ISS in April 2002, on which one of the crew will be Roberto Vittori, a European astronaut from Italy.
