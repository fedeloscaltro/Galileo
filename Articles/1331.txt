'No go' for Endeavour's Launch on Sunday
NASA has scheduled Space Shuttle Endeavour's next launch attempt for Monday 8 February at 10:14 CET. The Mission Management Team will meet just after midnight (00:15 CET) to give the 'go' to fill Endeavour's external fuel tank with propellant.
Tank loading would begin at 00:45 CET. Today's launch was scrubbed due to the low cloud ceiling.
