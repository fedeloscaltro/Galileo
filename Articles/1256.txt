Call for Media: Graduation ceremony for ESA’s new astronauts
ESA PR 25-2010 On Monday 22 November 2010, the European Space Agency (ESA) will hold, at the European Astronaut Centre (EAC) in Cologne, Germany, the official ceremony for its new astronauts, marking the completion of their Basic Training.
Press and selected guests will be able to take part in this ceremony and see exclusive images of an intense first year of training for these new career astronauts. Following the official part, media representatives will also have individual interview opportunities with the astronauts.
“These young men and woman represent Europe's ambition and great ability and expertise in human spaceflight and exploration. I am proud to have selected them and to see them getting ready for mission assignments. It is now our collective duty to secure a level of participation in international programmes that will provide enough opportunities for them all,” said Simonetta Di Pippo, ESA Director of Human Spaceflight.
Following the successful launches of the Columbus laboratory and the first Automated Transfer Vehicle, ESA has become a fully-fledged partner in the International Space Station (ISS). Entering a new phase of exploitation of the unique capabilities offered by the ISS with a permanent crew of six, ESA presented its six new astronaut candidates to the press on 20 May 2009:
They have now completed Basic Training, the first phase of astronaut education. This included information on ESA and other space agencies and their main space programmes. It also covered space engineering, electrical engineering and different science disciplines. The astronaut candidates then studied the major systems of the ISS and transportation systems, such as the Space Shuttle and Soyuz. The training concluded with specific topics such as scuba diving (as the basis for EVA training), robotics, survival training, rendezvous and docking, Russian language, and human behaviour and performance training.
”I am proud of the work done by the ESA/EAC teams to bring this heterogeneous group of six outstanding persons to an equivalent level knowledge certifying them as career astronauts,” said Michel Tognini, Head of the European Astronaut Centre.
