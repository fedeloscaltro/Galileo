The ISS is now open for business!
The European Space Agency is opening for business by launching the Open Call for Commercial Proposals for the commercial utilisation of the European segment of the International Space Station.
With this permanent Open Call, ESA is inviting the private entities that intend to use the Station commercially to submit their proposals. Details of this Open Call may be found at our ISS commercialisation website (see link at right of page).
If you feel that your organisation has the vision and skills to make use of the opportunities offered by the International Space Station then you are invited to respond to this Open Call for Commercial Proposals by submitting your business idea to the European Space Agency.
