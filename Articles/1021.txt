Young space artists wanted!
Junior art is breaking new ground for the international Humans in Space Youth Art Competition. “Be inspired, creative and heard” is the motto of this global contest that invites children of 10–18 years to create musical, literary, visual or video pieces of art.
Creative minds should be inspired by nothing less than the whole Universe for this competition.
The artists are challenged to express their vision of how humans will use science and technology to explore space and uncover its mysteries.
The competition aims to engage youth in shaping the future of space exploration.
There is total freedom to choose the format of the art sent in. From 3D images to videos, short stories or paintings, the work will be shared worldwide.
All artwork must be submitted online by 11 November. An international panel of judges, including artists, ESA scientists, engineers and astronauts, will review the entries and announce the winners in January.
The winning artwork will be incorporated into displays and performances around the globe, such as the Humans in Space Symposium in Germany next summer.
Participants from Mission-X: Train Like an Astronaut are also taking part in this competition.
