SpaceX's Crew-1 astronaut mission to the International Space Station in photos
SpaceX's Crew-1 mission, the first operational mission of a Crew Dragon spacecraft, will send four astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA. The mission is scheduled to lift off on Nov. 14 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. You can see the latest updates here.
