Live Internet briefings 36th ESA Parabolic Flight Campaign
The 36th ESA Parabolic Flight Campaign is currently underway in Bordeaux, France. A total of three flights are scheduled over three days, the first having taken place earlier today. At the end of each flight day, a daily briefing will be broadcast via webstream live from Bordeaux-MÃ©rignac Airport.
As with previous campaigns, the 36th campaign is organised by ESA to conduct research experiments in weightlessness, and to prepare experiments for space flights on board the International Space Station (ISS). In all, thirteen experiments will be conducted in the areas of physical sciences and life sciences, there is also one student experiment flying during this campaign.
The daily briefings will focus on the day's activities and include interviews with the scientists, as well as material recorded during the parabolic flights.
