Blue Origin-Led National Team Delivers Lunar Lander Engineering Mockup to NASA
Today, the Blue Origin-led Human Landing
System (HLS) National Team – comprised of Blue Origin, Lockheed Martin,
Northrop Grumman, and Draper – delivered an engineering mockup of a crew lander
vehicle that could take American astronauts to the Moon. The lander is set
up in the Space Vehicle Mockup Facility (SVMF), NASA Johnson Space Center’s
(JSC) iconic Building 9. The full-scale engineering mockup
showcases two elements of the National Team’s multi-element architecture – the
Ascent Element (AE) and Descent Element (DE). Standing at more than 40 feet,
it is the Blue Origin National Team’s update to Apollo’s Lunar Module (LM) and will
be used to validate the National Team’s approaches for getting crew,
equipment, supplies, and samples off and on the vehicle. The team will
collaborate with NASA organizations including JSC’s Astronaut Office
to perform engineering and crew operations tests with astronauts
aiming to fly the final system within several years.
“Testing this engineering mockup
for crew interaction is a step toward making this historic mission real,”
said Brent Sherwood, vice president of Advanced Development Programs, Blue
Origin. “The learning we get from full-scale mockups can’t be done any
other way. Benefitting from NASA’s expertise and feedback at this early stage
allows us to develop a safe commercial system that meets the agency’s needs.” The
National Team HLS design leverages significant prior work, flight heritage, and
a modular solution. Modular solutions help to enable faster progress due to the
independent development and testing of each element, which permits ongoing
improvements and evolution without impacting the full system. This also
provides flexibility in the use of different launch vehicles and different
concepts of operations.The Descent Element is based on Blue Origin’s
Blue Moon cargo lander and BE-7 LOX/hydrogen engine, both in development for
more than three years. The Ascent Element incorporates avionics, software, life
support hardware, crew interfaces, and mission operations from Lockheed
Martin’s human-rated, deep-space Orion vehicle that will fly on the Artemis I and
II missions. A consistent cockpit experience and training from Orion to the AE
makes the end-to-end mission safer for Artemis. The Transfer Element, a
propulsive stage that starts the lander on its descent trajectory from
lunar orbit, is based on Northrop Grumman’s Cygnus vehicle that provides
logistics resupply to the International Space Station; and Draper provides
descent guidance and avionics to the National Team.“Each partner brings its own outstanding legacy to the National Team. These include developing, integrating, and operating human-rated spacecraft, launch systems and planetary landers. Together we form an excellent team to send our next astronauts to the Moon in 2024,” said Kirk Shireman, vice president of Lunar Campaigns at Lockheed Martin Space. “Augmenting state of the art tools with physically being able to see, interact, and evaluate a full-up lander in person is critical. It will inform our design and requirements earlier in the program allowing us to accelerate our development and meet the 2024 lunar landing goal.”The mockup will remain at JSC through early 2021 for a series of tests and simulations. Over the coming months, the National Team will continue to build and increase mockup fidelity. NASA’s Human Landing System Program is managed at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama.

Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Draper, is working to offer a Human
Landing System for NASA’s Artemis program to return Americans to the lunar
surface – this time to stay. Blue Origin, as prime contractor, leads
program management, systems engineering, safety and mission assurance, and
mission engineering and operations; and develops the Descent Element. Lockheed
Martin develops the reusable Ascent Element vehicle and leads crewed flight
operations and training. Northrop Grumman develops the Transfer Element vehicle
that delivers the landing system into low lunar orbit for final descent. Draper
leads descent guidance and provides flight avionics.
