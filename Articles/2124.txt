8th Life Sciences Symposium, 2-7 June 2002
The European Space Agency (ESA), together with the International Society for Gravitational Physiology (ISGP), is to host the joint 23rd annual ISGP meeting and the 8th European Symposium on Life Sciences Research in Space, from 2-7 June 2002 in Stockholm, Sweden.
At the Symposium international biological scientists will present investigative results for their research in gravitational physiology.
Programme
There will be open sessions for slide and poster presentations about the effects of changes in magnitude and direction of the gravitational force environment on the physiology and behaviour of humans, animals, plants and cells.
The effects of weightlessness during space flight, acute and chronic acceleration, impact, vibration and the various forms of simulated weightlessness will be included in the open sessions, as well as consideration of the evolutionary consequences of gravity and the role of gravity in the manifestations of scale effects in animals and plants.
Guest speakers will present four half-day symposia on the following topics:
Young researchers contest
This year the symposium will be encouraging exceptional young researchers, previously not involved in space research, to present their research at the symposium.
Early registration for the symposium is open until 1 April 2002.
