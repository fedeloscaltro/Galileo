Columbus hatch opened for first time
The hatch to the European Columbus laboratory was opened for the first time at 15:08 CET today. ESA astronaut LÃ©opold Eyharts was the first to enter the newest addition to the International Space Station.
Wearing protective goggles and a facemask as a precaution against floating debris, Eyharts entered Columbus for partial ingress after ISS Commander Peggy Whitson opened the hatch.
Eyharts has started activating systems inside Columbus. ESA astronaut Hans Schlegel and Peggy Whitson are assisting Eyharts with tasks including the installation of power, data and fluid lines.
Official Columbus ingress is scheduled for 20:55 CET (19:55 UT).
