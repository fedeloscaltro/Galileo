Close and personal with the Space Station
The International Space Station was his home for six months. He knows every nook and cranny of it and now shares the secrets of this heavenly habitat with us. The next tour of the station is now departing from the ESA multimedia gallery.
ESA astronaut Frank De Winne, the first European to take command of the International Space Station (ISS), guides you through the main laboratories and modules of the ISS during his recent six-month OasISS mission, completed in December 2009.
The video tour includes exciting information about this unique technological achievement and the largest space structure ever built in partnership between 10 European countries (represented by ESA), the United States (NASA), Japan (JAXA), Canada (CSA) and Russia (Roscosmos).
The ISS is the largest peace-time international undertaking ever conceived, designed to maintain a long-term human presence in space and provide a platform for scientific and technological research. It is also serving as a stepping stone for future space exploration. This human outpost in Earth orbit is extending the boundaries of exploration, science, technology and medicine in new and exciting directions, and is host to astronauts and research facilities from around the world.
