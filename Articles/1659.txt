ATV arrives at Europe's Spaceport - story in pictures
After a transatlantic crossing by sea, Jules Verne, the first Automated Transfer Vehicle for the International Space Station, arrived at Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, yesterday morning.
Nearly two weeks after leaving Rotterdam harbour, the French cargo ship MN Toucan, carrying around 400 tonnes of spacecraft and equipment for the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), sailed into Pariacabo harbour on Monday afternoon.
Operations to unload the International Space Station (ISS) re-supply cargo spacecraft started later the same day. The final section of the ATV spacecraft was disembarked on Tuesday morning and driven by truck to the S5 building at Europe's Spaceport.
