About the Soyuz flights
During the MagISStra mission the International Space Station hosted nine people in total on their long-duration missions. When Paolo Nespoli arrived at the Station with his crew, Expedition 26 was aboard, and when they left the orbital outpost in May, the crew left aboard became members of Expedition 28.
The Expeditions are thus divided into two parts, each including two three-person Soyuz crews. The crews are launched with one Soyuz spacecraft and may land in a different one, if it has been longer at the Station and needs to be returned to Earth.

Expedition 25 began with the Soyuz TMA-18 undocking in September 2010. Three new crewmembers were launched on Soyuz TMA-01M on 7 October.
