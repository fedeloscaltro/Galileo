Last Wednesday ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain met Antonio Tajani, Vice-President of the European Commission in charge of Industry and Entrepreneurship, in Brussels, on the occasion of the visit of ESA astronaut Frank De Winne and his crewmates, Roman Romanenko and Bob Thirsk.
They exchanged views on the challenges of space exploration and the importance of Europeâ€™s involvement in international cooperation.
From 27 May to 1 December 2009 De Winne flew the OasISS long-duration mission on the International Space Station. During this flight De Winne became the first European and the first non-American and non-Russian Commander of the ISS, and was part of the first six-person ISS Expedition crew.
