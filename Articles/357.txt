Here's how to watch SpaceX launch the Crew-1 astronaut mission for NASA this week
NASA is all set for its first operational commercial crew mission with SpaceX, and will celebrate by broadcasting numerous events for the launch, dubbed Crew-1. Here's how you can tune in.
Crew-1 will carry four astronauts to the International Space Station (ISS), one more than the standard three-person crew of a Russian Soyuz. Participating Crew-1 astronauts are Crew Dragon commander Michael Hopkins (NASA), pilot Victor Glover (NASA), mission specialist Shannon Walker (NASA) and mission specialist Soichi Noguchi (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency).
Once at the space station, the four NASA astronauts will join the current Expedition 64 crew of NASA astronaut Kate Rubins and two Roscosmos cosmonauts, Sergey Ryzhikov and Sergey Kud-Sverchkov, bringing the orbiting laboratory's crew to seven people.

Crew-1 follows on from the shorter, successful Demo-2 mission that launched in May to the space station with two NASA astronauts, demonstrating that a SpaceX Crew Dragon could safely ferry people to space. NASA plans to shift most of its astronaut launches from Soyuz vehicles to SpaceX and Boeing commercial crew vehicles to allow for larger crews on the station and, launches from Florida.
Blast-off for Crew-1 is scheduled for 7:49 p.m. EST Saturday (Nov. 14) (0049 GMT Sunday, Nov. 15) from Launch Complex 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

Both events will be broadcast live on NASA Television and here at Space.com.
