UPDATE: SpaceX delays launch of 60 Starlink internet satellites
UPDATE for 9:39 pm ET: SpaceX has scrubbed tonight's launch of a Falcon 9 rocket carrying 60 Starlink internet satellites due to the need for "additional mission assurance." The next launch opportunity will be Monday, Nov. 23, at 9:34 p.m. EST (0234 GMT).
SpaceX will launch 60 new Starlink internet satellites into orbit on a used Falcon 9 rocket Monday night (Nov. 23) and you can watch it live online here, courtesy of SpaceX. Liftoff is set for 9:34 p.m. EST (0234 Nov. 23 GMT) from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.
The Falcon 9 rocket on this flight is making its seventh flight to space in a milestone for SpaceX's reusability effort. It launched the Telstar 18 VANTAGE satellite in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019 and four Starlink missions in May 2019, January of this, June and August.
This mission will be SpaceX's 16th batch of Starlink satellites to fly in orbit. SpaceX's webcast for the launch will begin about 15 minutes before liftoff (about 9:41 p.m. EST/0242 GMT). You can watch the launch in the window above or directly from SpaceX via its YouTube channel and launch website.
SpaceX is targeting Sunday, November 22 for launch of its sixteenth Starlink mission, which will launch 60 Starlink satellites from Space Launch Complex 40 (SLC-40) at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The instantaneous launch window is at 9:56 p.m. EST, 02:56 UTC on Monday, November 23.
The Falcon 9 first stage rocket booster supporting this mission previously flew on six other missions: the Telstar 18 VANTAGE mission in September 2018, the Iridium-8 mission in January 2019, and four Starlink missions in May 2019, January 2020, June 2020, and August 2020. Following stage separation, SpaceX will land Falcon 9’s first stage on the “Of Course I Still Love You” droneship, which will be located in the Atlantic Ocean. One half of Falcon 9’s fairing previously supported a mission, and the other half previously two.
You can watch a live webcast of this mission, which will begin about 15 minutes prior to liftoff, by clicking the image above.
Last month, SpaceX launched its “Better Than Nothing Beta” test program. Service invites were sent to a portion of those who requested availability updates on Starlink.com and who live in serviceable areas. A couple weeks ago, Canada granted Starlink regulatory approval and last week SpaceX rolled out the service to parts of parts of southern Canada.

Find out what the astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station are up to by tuning in to the "ISS Live" broadcast. Hear conversations between the crew and mission controllers on Earth and watch them work inside the U.S. segment of the orbiting laboratory. When the crew is off duty, you can enjoy live views of Earth from Space. You can watch and listen in the window below, courtesy of NASA.
"Live video from the International Space Station includes internal views when the crew is on-duty and Earth views at other times. The video is accompanied by audio of conversations between the crew and Mission Control. This video is only available when the space station is in contact with the ground. During 'loss of signal' periods, viewers will see a blue screen.
"Since the station orbits the Earth once every 90 minutes, it experiences a sunrise or a sunset about every 45 minutes. When the station is in darkness, external camera video may appear black, but can sometimes provide spectacular views of lightning or city lights below."
