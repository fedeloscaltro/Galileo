ESA Council congratulates Reiter on 100th day
In a call made from ESA's headquarters in Paris, ESA Council Chairman Professor Sigmar Wittig and ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain yesterday congratulated Thomas Reiter on his 100th day on board the International Space Station.
Speaking from inside a meeting room on the second day of the ESA Council Meeting, Professor Wittig was first to congratulate Reiter on his latest achievement.
ESA astronaut and ISS Expedition 14 Flight Engineer Reiter thanked the ESA Council for their message, "It is definitely a pleasure to be up here," he said. "In retrospect these 100 days went by like in the blink of an eye. The Space Station is really a fascinating building."
Professor Wittig shared with Reiter the news that the ESA Council has reached a decision to unblock funds for the Space Station. Dordain jokingly added, "OK Thomas, since now we have a budget you will have some food for the rest of your flight."
