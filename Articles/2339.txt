Aurora Industry Day
Aurora Industry Day took place during the ESA Industry Space Days, held at ESA's scientific and research organisation, ESTEC, from 24 to 26 November. This three-day event brings together most European players in the space sector, including large and small system integrators, and system, subsystem and instrument suppliers.
The last of the industry space days was devoted to presenting the Aurora Programme - and details of activities to be carried out in 2004 - to the many European industrialists and representative of European SMEs present.
Among the visitors to the ESA Industry Day were the winning teams of the Aurora Student Design Contest. During the day, the students were invited to show their prize-winning design projects and were able to meet with representatives of industry and ESA experts.
