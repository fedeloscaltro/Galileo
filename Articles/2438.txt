AMASE student blog: Last minute fixes
Today has been all about fixing last minute problems – a tube breaking on a pump, motors that need replacement etc. so time has just drifted by helping out wherever an extra set of hands were needed.
A few Norwegian politicians have stopped by to have a look at things, but otherwise the day has been drenched in intense work, buying last minute equipment for the trip (beers…) ;-) and information how to (mostly how NOT to) behave on board the boat.
Tonight we’ll have to pack down all of the equipment so it can be transferred to the ship in the morning, which will probably cause a lot of chaos...
