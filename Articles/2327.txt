EuroNews looks at life on Mars!
Is there life on Mars? ESA's Mars Express satellite, launched in 2003, has been scanning and mapping the surface of our rocky neighbour, and it has found that there are both substantial deposits of water ice below the Martian crust and traces of methane in the Martian atmosphere.
The next step is ExoMars, due for launch in 2013, which will place a lander on the surface of the red planet with the express aim of searching for past or present signs of life. EuroNews talked to the scientists at the cutting edge of this research.
