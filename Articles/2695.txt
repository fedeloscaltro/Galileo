Ingredients for Life: On Earth and in Space
We now have the capability to leave planet Earth. However, if we are to live in space and travel to other planets, we must learn how to survive out there for longer periods of time. We have to recreate in space the vital ingredients for life on Earth.
On the International Space Station many of Earthâ€™s environmental support systems have already been engineered. Examining how some of these key technologies work, allows us to understand the vital ingredients that make Earth such an ideal place to live.
In the DVD 'Ingredients for Life: On Earth and in Space', aimed primarily at 16-18 year old students, we explore how ESA is dealing with scientific and technological challenges, and we answer questions like: Why do we need water and oxygen? How do astronauts get the oxygen they need to survive in space?
