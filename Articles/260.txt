Club for the Future Debuts At-Home Curriculum for Virtual Learning
While students, educators, and parents are doing their part during this dynamic time to learn at home, Club for the Future wants to help.To inspire K-12 students to pursue careers in STEM and help visualize the future of life in space, Blue Origin’s nonprofit Club for the Future has developed a Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) aligned curriculum for teachers, parents and students. The virtual lesson plans are now live on the Club’s website for easy download.The curriculum can also be found on Flipgrid. Flipgrid is a free platform accessible by every school district using Microsoft 365 as well any student or teacher with a Microsoft or Google email account. On the site, students have the ability to connect, review their work, and build a community while they are at home.The initial lesson plans focus on designing new technology innovations, dreaming up a governing space constitution and creating new business ventures – all for a future of life in space. Building on the success of Club for the Future’s current postcard program, each lesson encourages students to write or draw their big idea on a Club for the Future postcard. Once mailed in, Blue Origin will send the postcards to space on a future New Shepard launch, then mail the postcards back to each student stamped “Flown to Space”.  For the Club’s first mission, Blue Origin flew thousands of postcards from students around the world to space and back on the New Shepard rocket in December 2019. About Club for the FutureFounded in 2019 by Blue Origin, Club for the Future brings together teachers and K-12 students from around the world to engage in activities giving youth direct access to space through Blue Origin’s reusable launch vehicles.
