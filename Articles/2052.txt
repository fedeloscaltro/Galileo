Teach Space in Primary Education workshop
The invitations to attend the Teach Space in Primary Education workshop have now been distributed. ESA would like to thank all the teachers who returned the questionnaire. The input we received is of great value in helping us to further define the primary education content within the ISS Education Programme.
In selecting the workshop participants, priority has been given to teachers of the 8 to 12 age group, who have not been to an ESA educational event before, and finally no more than two teachers per country.
We received a great number of applications to participate in the workshop. We are sorry that not all applications can be honoured this time.
The input we received from the questionnaires has helped us in preparing the programme for the two-day workshop. The main focus of the workshop is for ESA to better understand how we can provide and support teachers in primary education.
The workshop participants will support us in identifying,
the common elements of European curricula
teaching methods and practise throughout Europe
The Teach Space in Primary Education workshop will be held on 3-4 March at ESA’s research and technology centre, ESTEC, in Noordwijk, the Netherlands. We anticipate an inspiring event for all participants.
