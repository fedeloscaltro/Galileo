Space for inspiration
Spaceflight is one of the most inspiring endeavours of humankind. ESA and experts from many disciplines look at how human spaceflight has changed our daily lives, what the future holds, and the inspiring research and work done across many disciplines and industries.
The Space for Inspiration event took place on 14–15 September at the London Science Museum and featured talks by ESA astronauts Tim Peake and Luca Parmitano, NASA astronaut Don Pettit and ESA Director General Jan Woerner.
Replays from the two-day event are available below. The full programme and more information can be found at: http://space4inspiration.esa.int/
Space for Inspiration is a celebration of the diversity and pervasiveness of space in technology, industry and culture. Other speakers will introduce work that uses space technology or used space as inspiration, including Michelin-starred chef Thorsten Schmidt, research doctor Beth Healey – who spent a year in Antarctica – Politecnico di Milano professor of design Annalisa Dominoni, and the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s education engineer David Honess.
