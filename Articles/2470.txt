School children inspired by human spaceflight
These images show a series of drawings received by ESA from pupils at the Anne Frank Schule in Germany. The drawings, sent by one of their teachers together with an evaluation of the ISS Education Kit, are a beautiful, positive reminder of what human spaceflight is in the imagination of our children.
