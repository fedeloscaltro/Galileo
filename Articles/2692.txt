The ISS Education Kit is aimed at teachers of secondary school pupils aged 12-15. ESA has developed the kit using input from teachers.
Five chapters use various aspects of ISS to present inter-disciplinary exercises common to European curricula. The text describes what the ISS is, how it is being built, what it is like to live and work on board, and what future voyages will be like.
There are not only text and explanations about the International Space Station, but also related inter-disciplinary exercises, a teacher's guide and a glossary.
