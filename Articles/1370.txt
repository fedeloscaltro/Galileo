Watch the landing of Space Shuttle Discovery live
Having completed their mission at the International Space Station, Space Shuttle Discovery and the STS-128 crew, including ESA astronaut Christer Fuglesang, are heading home. Discovery is set to land at Edwards Air Force Base on 12 September at 02:53 CEST.
The first two landing opportunities early on Friday morning were waved off due to adverse weather at the landing site at NASA's Kennedy Space Center (KSC), Florida.
Weather conditions at KSC have prevented a landing at KSC on Friday evening and early Saturday. Discovery's next landing opportunities tonight are for Edwards Air Force Base in California at 02:53 and 04:28 CEST (00:53 and 02:28 UT).
