ESA has produced a binder for primary school teachers who are eager to use space as a motivating tool for teaching subjects ranging from science to art.
The A4-sized binder contains four chapters devoted to explaining various aspects of life in space and what is it like to live and work on board the International Space Station. Each chapter contains background information, worksheets and a teacherâ€™s guide. A glossary and colour posters complete the content.
The kit can be used as the basis for classroom lessons; for group exercises; or to be given out as homework. Individual pages can be photocopied and distributed to each pupil.
