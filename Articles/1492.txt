Replay undocking Jules Verne ATV
The view from the International Space Station as Europe’s first Automated Transfer Vehicle, Jules Verne, retreats away from the orbital outpost following undocking.
At the end of a flawless six-month mission, Jules Verne ATV undocked from the International Space Station on 5 September 2008 at 23:29 hours CEST (21:29 UT).
The ATV has now embarked on the last leg of its journey in space, which will end with a controlled destructive re-entry into the Earth’s atmosphere on 29 September.
This video was recorded from inside the ATV Control Centre in Toulouse, France.
