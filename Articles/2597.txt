What is a trace gas?
A trace gas makes up less than 1% by volume of a planet’s atmosphere. Trace gases in the martian atmosphere include methane, water vapour, nitrogen dioxide and acetylene. Although making up a very small amount of the overall atmospheric inventory, methane in particular holds key clues to the planet’s current state of activity.
