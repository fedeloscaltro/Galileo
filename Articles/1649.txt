Columbus Media Day at Kennedy Space Centre
See ESA’s Columbus laboratory being readied for launch to the International Space Station and meet ESA experts at the Kennedy Space Centre, Florida on 10 October.
Two major European-built modules will be delivered and attached to the International Space Station (ISS) with the next two launches of the Space Shuttle. Three ESA astronauts will take part in these two complex Shuttle missions. Astronaut Paolo Nespoli, from Italy, will fly on board Space Shuttle Discovery on 23 October while Hans Schlegel from Germany and Léopold Eyharts from France will fly on board Space Shuttle Atlantis on 6 December. With these missions, ESA will own part of the only permanent human outpost in space, heralding a new era as Europe will get permanent access to space research in weightlessness.
The first of the Shuttle missions, STS-120, will lift Node-2 into orbit. The Italian-built Node-2 is an extension and connecting port for the ISS. ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli will have a major role in installing that element. The mission, dubbed Esperia from the Ancient Greek name for the Italian peninsula, foresees five spacewalks.
Astronauts Hans Schlegel and Léopold Eyharts will fly to the ISS as part of the STS-122 crew and they will deliver the Columbus Laboratory to the ISS. Columbus will be attached to the ISS during a space walk in which ESA astronaut Hans Schlegel will take part.
The Columbus laboratory is launched pre-equipped with multi-disciplinary science facilities. After 12 days in space, Hans Schlegel will return to Earth with the Shuttle, while Leopold Eyharts will remain on the ISS for two more months to oversee the in-orbit commissioning of Columbus and its experimental facilities.
On Wednesday 10 October, ESA project managers, engineers and other experts will be available at KSC for a last visit to the Columbus laboratory and for interviews. A visit of NASA’s Shuttle launch facilities will give media representatives a complete overview of the preparation process that will lead to the launch of Columbus in early December.
The attached programme provides the timeline of this event. To request badging for access to NASA KSC media representatives must fill in accreditation details electronically at https://media.ksc.nasa.gov before Friday 21 September at the latest.
