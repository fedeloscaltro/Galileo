Launch of Director’s Corner for Human Spaceflight
A new Director’s Corner for the ESA Director of Human Spaceflight, Simonetta Di Pippo, has been launched today on the ESA website.
The Director’s corner is another channel for us to keep you up to date on ESA’s human spaceflight and exploration programmes, strategy, goals and achievements.
"It is my pleasure to offer this new window on the human spaceflight and exploration activities for the general public. This Directorate is constantly working to provide new means of communication with and ways to get feedback from people interested in our programmes, events and space exploration in general," says Mrs Di Pippo.
Among other features, the Director’s Corner gives you the opportunity to send comments, suggestions, news and feedback to the Director via a dedicated email inbox.
At the moment, the site contains the Director’s biography, her agenda and a photo gallery featuring her participation in key events.
The site is supplemented with additional downloads, such as programme brochures and presentations. It is expected that more features will be added in response to the communication needs of the Directorate and its stakeholders.
