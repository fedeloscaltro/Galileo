Call for Media: Follow the launch of ESA astronaut André Kuipers
PR 35 2011 - ESA astronaut André Kuipers is scheduled for launch to the International Space Station on 21 December. Media are invited to cover the event via ESA TV or ESA's web site or attend one of the ESA events in the Netherlands and Germany.
André Kuipers will be launched on a Soyuz to the International Space Station on his five-month PromISSe mission at 14:16 CET (13:16 GMT) on 21 December from Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.
PromISSe is Europe's fourth long-duration flight to the orbital outpost, and André's second mission to the Station. His duties during the five-month mission will include being the prime operator for Europe's supply spacecraft, ATV Edoardo Amaldi, when it arrives at the Station in March next year.
Similarly, André will be involved in berthing the visiting Cygnus and Dragon US cargo vehicles during their maiden demonstration flights to the Station.
He will also conduct an extensive programme of educational and scientific experiments, benefitting from his background as a medical doctor.
