Night of the astronauts
As part of German Space Day activities, ESA is organising a ‘gala’ night on 17 September in the KölnArena in Cologne (Germany). All the members of the European Astronaut Corps and their colleagues from Russia and the USA will be on hand to guide the public through a fantastic journey into space. This journey will bring the dream of space to the heart of this historic city.
Hosted by German TV presenter Evi Seibert and ESA astronaut Ulf Merbold, the public can see all stages of a journey into space, from training, to the launch, from docking to landing. Highlights include an uplink to the ISS, images and videos from recent astronaut missions and from Mars Express, live 3D camera and laser show, and most important the chance to meet the astronauts and hear at first hand about their remarkable adventures.
