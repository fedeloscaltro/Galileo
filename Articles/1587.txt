ISS, ATV and Shuttle briefings on NASA TV
NASA will hold four media briefings this week to discuss International Space Station activities and to provide a status of launch preparations for the STS-122 Shuttle mission. The final briefing will preview the launch and docking of the Jules Verne Automated Transfer Vehicle.
NASA Television also will provide live coverage of a 30 January Space Station spacewalk, featuring Expedition 16 Commander Peggy Whitson and Flight Engineer Daniel Tani.
The first briefing at 20:00 CET on Monday 28 January, will preview the spacewalk. On 30 January, NASA TV coverage of the spacewalk will begin at 10:00 CET. After completion of the spacewalk, a briefing will be held at approximately 20:00 CET.
During the spacewalk astronauts will replace a motor that enables one of the Station's solar arrays to pivot toward the Sun. The motor experienced electrical failures in early December 2007.
Also on 30 January, Space Shuttle managers will hold a briefing no earlier than 21:00 CET, following a meeting that will set an official launch date for Space Shuttle Atlantis' STS-122 flight to carry the European Columbus laboratory into orbit. Liftoff currently is targeted for 7 February.
On Thursday 31 January, officials from NASA and the European Space Agency will preview the maiden launch and docking of ESA's 'Jules Verne' Automated Transfer Vehicle.
