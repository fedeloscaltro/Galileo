Discovery launch delayed
Today's launch of Space Shuttle Discovery has been postponed due to an issue with a low-level fuel cut-off sensor onboard the vehicle. The sensor protects the orbiter's main engines by triggering them to shut down in the event fuel runs unexpectedly low. A new launch date has not yet been announced.
