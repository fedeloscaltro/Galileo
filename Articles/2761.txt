Lessons from space
The International Space Station is a unique platform for humans to look back on Earth and gain new perspective.
One of ESA astronaut Alexander Gerst’s important duties during his mission will be to capture views from space, convey how fragile our planet is and share his experience with schoolchildren worldwide.
The Station is not only our best microgravity laboratory, but also a spectacular adventure playground.
Alexander performed a set of experiments in orbit with the help of the next generation of scientists, comparing results and working together to protect the planet.
Students learned about the differences between living in space and on Earth. Europe’s ambassador in space triggered youngsters’ creative minds by showing them the world from a distance – 400 km up.
It is important to do something you like to do. Everybody has something they can do better than others. What I can do well is analyse things, be curious and discover things. I became scientist because I loved it, and that led to me being an astronaut
The Blue Dot educational activities aim to stimulate their curiosity and bring awareness of the Space Station as a testbed for future exploration.
Alexander’s lessons from space continue even after the mission ended. Educational videos were released when back on Earth.
