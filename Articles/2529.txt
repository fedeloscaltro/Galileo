Chance to meet ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano
There is a chance for bookworms and Spacetweeps alike to meet ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano at the Libreria Assaggi bookshop in Rome, Italy, Saturday 23 February at 15:00 CET.
Thousands of Twitter users have been enjoying the entertaining tweets of @Astro_Luca  as he prepares for his Volare mission, training at Star City, the European Astronaut Centre and Johnson Space Center.
Luca will spend six months on the International Space Station starting at the end of May under an agreement with Italy’s ASI space agency and NASA.
What to do while waiting to go to Baikonur? easy: a 15k run in the snow this morning, a 3.2k swim this afternoon (no snow). Happy as a clam.
How to join
Twitter followers have the chance to catch up with Luca during a brief break in his training schedule. Places are limited, so if you would like to join this informal event at Libreria Assaggi, please let us know by tweeting to @ESA_Italia, with the hashtag #astro_Luca.
The event is open to Twitter followers of @Astro_Luca, @ESA, @ESA_Italia and @Spacetweetup.
The event is expected to last about an hour. @ESA and @ESA_Italia will be there to welcome you. Please make yourselves known to us on arrival.
Astronaut fashion: trying hard to look good and failing miserably! And I'm not talking about the traditional hats :) pic.twitter.com/gemaQhv2
