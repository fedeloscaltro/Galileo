Future scientists attend 'Life in Space' programme
From 5 to 15 September, ESA supported the 'Life in Space' programme at the Arago Laboratory in Banyuls-sur-Mer, France. Approximately fifty life sciences students from around Europe attended the course, which introduced to the latest European research in space biology through an intensive programme of lectures and workshops.
Lectures
The goal of this course is to familiarise the students with the range of space-related biological disciplines in which research is being carried out in Europe. The students attended data analysis workshops as well as lectures on the space environment, the origins of life, and the role of gravity in cellular, animal and plant development.
Throughout the two weeks, the students also worked in small groups to design their own space projects, practicing science as well as teamwork. On their last day at the Arago Laboratory the students presented their projects to each other. There was also some time to relax during their stay, with visits to both the Tautavel Prehistoric Museum and to Château de Salses.
ESA support
For the last few years ESA as the main non-academic partner financially supported ‘Life in Space’, as well as providing computer equipment for the students to use during the course. Two ESA experts presented lectures to the students.
Collaboration
The ERASMUS/SOCRATES-supported course is carried out in collaboration with five European universities, namely University Pierre et Marie Curie Paris VI, France, in cooperation with the Arago Laboratory in Banyuls; University of Bonn, Germany; University of Sassari, Italy; University of Nottingham, England and Autonomous University of Madrid, Spain.
