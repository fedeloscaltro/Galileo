Watch on Euronews: Surviving the long journey to Mars
Locked in a giant tin can for months on end, isolated from the outside world, it is a claustrophobe's worst nightmare. In Moscow, scientists are trying to find out how well humans would survive the 18-month journey to the Red Planet. This is a vital experiment if a long-held dream to put human life on Mars is ever to become a reality.
