Frank De Winne reflects on historic anniversary
In this short video clip recorded on the International Space Station, ESA astronaut Frank De Winne reflects on the 40th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.
De Winne is a member of the first crew of six currently living and working on the International Space Station. He is scheduled to remain in orbit until the end of November this year.
During his mission, named OasISS, De Winne will use the scientific facilities of the ISS, especially the European Columbus laboratory, to undertake a European programme of scientific experiments and technology demonstrations.
Following a crew rotation in October, he will also become the commander of the Station until his return to Earth in November. He is the first European to take on this role.
