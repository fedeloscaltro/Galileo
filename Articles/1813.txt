Discover European space with a stroll around the “International Space Village” at ILA2006
ESA PR 16-2006. From Tuesday 16 to Sunday 21 May 2006, ESA will participate in the ILA2006 International Air Show in Berlin, together with the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt, DLR (German Aerospace Centre) and the German Space Industries Association, BDLI.
Over 1000 exhibitors from more than 40 countries will be gathering at Berlin-Schönefeld Airport to display their latest aircraft and a wide range of products, systems and processes representing every area of this high tech industry and, of course, Space!
At the “International Space Village” European space programmes and activities will be highlighted by means of an exhibition and special events and presentations addressed to politicians, decision makers, the international space community, media and general public.
ESA is exhibiting along with the DLR and BDLI in a 1400 m2 pavilion to promote space as an essential factor in discovery, competitiveness and European identity. Key areas and specific missions will be promoted: Launchers, Human Spaceflight, Exploration, Space Science, Earth Observation, Navigation, Operations and Technology.
Throughout the week, a stage set up in the space pavilion will host various kinds of presentations and events. The programme is being finalised and will be posted on the ESA and DLR websites at a later stage. Interviews with ESA directors, senior management, programme specialists and astronauts can be arranged upon request.
